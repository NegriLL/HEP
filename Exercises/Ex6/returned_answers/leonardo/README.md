After many attempts, I kept getting SEGFAULTS from any attempt to use TF1 to fit
the data in the histogram. I do not understand if it's this machine or a problem
with data ownership in the code. Fixes in the root-forum did not help. so I
decided to either comment out or remove the problematic lines of code.
