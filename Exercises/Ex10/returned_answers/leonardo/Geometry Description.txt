The detector is comprised of a series of lead absorbers filled with liquid argon
between them. The default matterial is called "Galactic" and is set to simulate
the vaccuum we would find in space.

The geometry of the detector can be described as 10 rectangular layers. Each
layer has the lead absorber and a gap of "galactic"
